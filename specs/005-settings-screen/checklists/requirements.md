# Specification Quality Checklist: Settings Screen

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-03-30  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items passed validation on first iteration.
- The spec deliberately avoids mentioning Flutter, Dart, Provider, SharedPreferences, or any specific technology — keeping it technology-agnostic as required.
- "Coming Soon" strategy for unsupported backend features (password change, account deletion) is documented in both Assumptions and FR-014.
- Scope boundaries clearly separate in-scope UI/preference work from out-of-scope backend changes.
- 9 user stories cover all sections of the settings screen, prioritized P1-P3.
- 23 functional requirements are each independently testable.
- 9 success criteria are measurable and user-focused.
