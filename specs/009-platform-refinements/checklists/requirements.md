# Specification Quality Checklist: Platform Refinements (Localization, Admin Alerts & Trip-Creation UX)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- `/speckit.clarify` completed on 2026-06-14 (4 questions): admin-alert channel (web push from dashboard), approval-freshness trigger (re-check on create-flow entry + foreground), payment-alert scope (in-app fee payments only), and localization scope (mobile + dashboard) are now resolved in the spec. The location-suggestion provider is intentionally deferred to `/speckit.plan`.
